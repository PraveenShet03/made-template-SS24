### Title

Investigating the Impact of Weather Conditions on Traffic Flow in Dublin

<img src="project\made.png" width="800" height="466">

### Main Question

How do daily weather conditions affect traffic flow in Dublin? Is there a significant correlation between weather parameters and traffic patterns?

### Description

The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between weather and traffic flow in Dublin. I want to see if there is a significant correlation between daily traffic data and weather parameters like temperature, rainfall, humidity, and wind speed. Understanding this correlation can provide valuable insights for city planners and traffic management authorities, assisting in improving traffic flow and reducing congestion. In this study I plan to use statistical analysis and data visualisation techniques to identify patterns and trends, providing a comprehensive picture of how weather affects traffic in Dublin.
