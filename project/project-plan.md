# Project Plan

## Title

Exploring the correlation of Temperature, Rainfall, and Humidity in North-east England: A Decadal Analysis (2010-2019).

## Main Question

To how much extent do the factors temperature and humidity effect the amount of rainfall in the city Newcastle upon Tyne.

## Description

The project's goal is to assess and illustrate the correlation between humidity, temperature and avergae rainfall. Agriculture and tourism are two examples of industries that can minimise risks and optimise operations related to climate variability. To understand the complex interaction of these variables, the approach involves statistical analysis and data visualisation techniques. Hoping that the findings will aid in a better understanding of local climate dynamics.

## Datasources

### Datasource1: Average rainfall and temperature data
* Metadata URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryakrishnanar/average-rainfall-and-temperature-in-uk20102019
* Data URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryakrishnanar/average-rainfall-and-temperature-in-uk20102019?select=avg_rainfalltemp+in+UK+-+Sheet1.csv
* Data Type: CSV

This file contains average rainfall (mm) and average temperature (centigrade) for the North East England for the period 2010-2019.

This dataset shows the average rainfall in millimeters and average temperature in centigrade by month, year, and meteorological season. It also has an annual figure for each year.

### Datasource2: Weather data
* Metadata URL: N/A
* Data URL: https://power.larc.nasa.gov/data-access-viewer/
* Data Type: CSV

This file contains temperature and humidity data for 2010-2019.
